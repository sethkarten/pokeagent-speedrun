3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

A powerful sandstorm rages on, forcing travelers to detour around it on their way past. A house belonging to theWinstrate familystands at the water's edge.\n\n\n### Winstrate House\n\nThe upstandingWinstrate familyloves challenging visitors to battle. Speak to the man at the front door, and he asks if you would like to take his family on in four back-to-back battles, with no break to heal your team. Defeat each one in turn, and afterward, enter the house and talk to Victoria to receive aMacho Braceas a reward.\n\n\n### Gabby and Ty\n\nGabby and Ty, the reporter-cameraman team you met back inSlateport, can be found standing along the road. Accept their challenge to demonstrate your battle prowess, and they will beg for an interview afterwards. Find aTVafterwards for a chance to hear about yourself on the news!\n\n\n## Route 112 (south)\n\nRoute 112lies at the foot ofMt. Chimney, and a cable car service allows visitors to reach the summit.A tunnelcuts through the mountainside to reach the northern part of the route, whileLavaridge TownandJagged Passlie off to the west.\n\n\n### Access Denied\n\nA pair ofTeam MagmaGrunts are guarding the cable car station, so no one can reach the summit of Mt. Chimney right now. In addition, the elevated terrain makes westward travel impossible, so the only other way forward is a steamy tunnel through the mountainside.\n\n\n## Fiery Path\n\nThe swelteringFiery Path, a passage that leads through the base ofMt. Chimney, is filled with Pokémon that thrive in the heat. The main passage leads to the north side ofRoute 112, while a pair ofbouldersprevent anyone from exploring the oppressive side tunnels for now.\n\n\n## Route 112 (north)\n\nAfter passing throughFiery Path, you re-emerge onRoute 112's north hill. Be sure to harvest some Berries from the nearby trees on your way eastward. The wild Pokémon here are the same as those on the southern half.\n\n\n## Route 111 (north)\n\nTaking the long way throughRoute 112and theFiery Pathhas allowed you to avoid the sandstorm raging just south of here. An old lady resides in a house at the foot of the section and can fully heal your party. You may wish to have theMach Bikewith you to fight every Trainer in this section. Continue toRoute 113.\n\n\n### A Secret Power\n\nAs you proceed northward, you find a boy staring at a large tree. Speak to him, and he explains that he is considering using a certain move to create a room for himself inside the tree. He gives youTM43(Secret Power) so that you can establish your ownSecret Basein any of the suspicious-lookingtrees, wall markings, and clumps of grassscattered across the region. Now you can access the TM shop inSlateport City. A Trainer can decorate their Secret Base as they wish, and can display up to 16decorations.\n\n\n## Route 113\n\nSituated betweenRoute 111's north end andFallarbor Town,Route 113is constantly covered inMt. Chimney'svolcanic ashby the same wind patterns that keepVerdanturf Town's air clear and fresh. TheGlass Workshopstands on the north ridge, where a gifted artist crafts useful items from pure ash.\n\n\n### Glass Workshop\n\nTheGlass Workshopstands near the route's west end. Step inside and talk to the owner to receive a freeSoot Sack, which can be used to collect ash by running throughash-covered tall grass (andJagged Passlater on). The amount of ash collected is determined by the number of steps you've walked through ash-covered grass. The constantly-falling ash replenishes these piles whenever you return to the area.\n\nSpeak with the workshop owner to learn how much ash you've collected. By providing him with the correct amounts, he is able to create valuable glass items.\n\n\n## Fallarbor Town\n\nThe small town ofFallarboris located between Routes113and114, and features rich soil perfect for gardening. A thirdBattle Tentis located here. The town is also home to aMove ManiacandProfessor Cozmo.\n\n\n### Meet Lanette\n\nInside the Pokémon Center, you find the PC in use by a woman namedLanette. She upgraded the previous version of thePokémon Storage System, adding a user-friendly graphical interface, the ability to store over 400 Pokémon, and the ability to change thewallpaperof each Box. As she leaves, she invites you to visit her home onRoute 114.\n\n\n### Move Tutor\n\nThere is a girl inside the Poké Mart, examining the merchandise displayed on the rear wall. Speak to her, and she offers to teach the moveMetronometo a Pokémon, one time only.\n\n\n### Battle Tent\n\nTheFallarbor Battle Tentstands on the north side of town, and is the third of three scattered throughoutHoenn. At this location, challengers select three of their Pokémon to battle three opposing Trainers. These Trainers' Pokémon will either be level 30, or match the highest-leveled Pokémon in your party, whichever is higher. Each separate Pokémon face-off has a three-turn limit. If neither Pokémon has been knocked out in that time, the judge makes a ruling that depends on three factors: Mind, the amount of offensive moves; Skill, the accuracy of moves; and Body, the remaining HP. Possible scores for each category include Circle (a win, 2 points), Triangle (a tie, 1 point), and X (a loss, 0 points). The Pokémon that earns the most points wins. The reward for winning three consecutive battles here is aHyper Potion.\n\nScottcan be found inside the entry hall. He is impressed that you've stopped by, as most people around here are easygoing and laid-back, and urges you to make a challenge.\n\n\n### Move Maniac\n\nTheMove Maniaclives in the northwest house. This helpful guy knows every move a Pokémon can learn as it grows, and is able to teach forgotten moves to any Pokémon, for a price. He charges a singleHeart Scalefor each move relearned. While a few can be found on the beach as invisible items right now, you will need to wait until you encounter wildLuvdisclater on to be able to collect a more steady supply.\n\n\n## Route 114\n\nPockmarked by fallen Meteorites, the lengthyRoute 114leads up the mountainside toMeteor Falls. TheFossil Maniaclives up north, whileLanette's home stands on the water's edge.\n\n\n### Fossil Maniac\n\nTheFossil Maniac's house stands on the outskirts ofFallarbor Town. Head inside and talk to his little brother, who kindly gives youTM28(Dig). When used in the field, Dig can be used while in a cave to return to the entrance. If you visit the cave at the back of the house, you will find the Fossil Maniac hard at work. He won't give up any Fossils, but hints that others may be uncovered byRoute 111's raging sandstorm.\n\n\n### Lanette's House\n\nGo south across the bridge to reachLanette's house. Inside, you find the woman struggling to organize her clutter. She is happy that you stopped by, but embarrassed by the state of her home. If you promise to keep her messiness a secret, she will give you aLotad Dollin return.\n\n\n### A Berry A Day\n\nSpeak to the boy outside Lanette's house and he will give out one random Berry from a group of five every day.", 'description': 'Pokemon Emerald Walkthrough - Part 6'}

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

2025-11-10 02:47:52,142 - utils.vlm - INFO - [CLI_Agent] PROMPT: You are an expert navigator and battle strategist playing Pokémon Emerald on a Game Boy Advance emulator.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

A powerful sandstorm rages on, forcing travelers to detour around it on their way past. A house belonging to theWinstrate familystands at the water's edge.\n\n\n### Winstrate House\n\nThe upstandingWinstrate familyloves challenging visitors to battle. Speak to the man at the front door, and he asks if you would like to take his family on in four back-to-back battles, with no break to heal your team. Defeat each one in turn, and afterward, enter the house and talk to Victoria to receive aMacho Braceas a reward.\n\n\n### Gabby and Ty\n\nGabby and Ty, the reporter-cameraman team you met back inSlateport, can be found standing along the road. Accept their challenge to demonstrate your battle prowess, and they will beg for an interview afterwards. Find aTVafterwards for a chance to hear about yourself on the news!\n\n\n## Route 112 (south)\n\nRoute 112lies at the foot ofMt. Chimney, and a cable car service allows visitors to reach the summit.A tunnelcuts through the mountainside to reach the northern part of the route, whileLavaridge TownandJagged Passlie off to the west.\n\n\n### Access Denied\n\nA pair ofTeam MagmaGrunts are guarding the cable car station, so no one can reach the summit of Mt. Chimney right now. In addition, the elevated terrain makes westward travel impossible, so the only other way forward is a steamy tunnel through the mountainside.\n\n\n## Fiery Path\n\nThe swelteringFiery Path, a passage that leads through the base ofMt. Chimney, is filled with Pokémon that thrive in the heat. The main passage leads to the north side ofRoute 112, while a pair ofbouldersprevent anyone from exploring the oppressive side tunnels for now.\n\n\n## Route 112 (north)\n\nAfter passing throughFiery Path, you re-emerge onRoute 112's north hill. Be sure to harvest some Berries from the nearby trees on your way eastward. The wild Pokémon here are the same as those on the southern half.\n\n\n## Route 111 (north)\n\nTaking the long way throughRoute 112and theFiery Pathhas allowed you to avoid the sandstorm raging just south of here. An old lady resides in a house at the foot of the section and can fully heal your party. You may wish to have theMach Bikewith you to fight every Trainer in this section. Continue toRoute 113.\n\n\n### A Secret Power\n\nAs you proceed northward, you find a boy staring at a large tree. Speak to him, and he explains that he is considering using a certain move to create a room for himself inside the tree. He gives youTM43(Secret Power) so that you can establish your ownSecret Basein any of the suspicious-lookingtrees, wall markings, and clumps of grassscattered across the region. Now you can access the TM shop inSlateport City. A Trainer can decorate their Secret Base as they wish, and can display up to 16decorations.\n\n\n## Route 113\n\nSituated betweenRoute 111's north end andFallarbor Town,Route 113is constantly covered inMt. Chimney'svolcanic ashby the same wind patterns that keepVerdanturf Town's air clear and fresh. TheGlass Workshopstands on the north ridge, where a gifted artist crafts useful items from pure ash.\n\n\n### Glass Workshop\n\nTheGlass Workshopstands near the route's west end. Step inside and talk to the owner to receive a freeSoot Sack, which can be used to collect ash by running throughash-covered tall grass (andJagged Passlater on). The amount of ash collected is determined by the number of steps you've walked through ash-covered grass. The constantly-falling ash replenishes these piles whenever you return to the area.\n\nSpeak with the workshop owner to learn how much ash you've collected. By providing him with the correct amounts, he is able to create valuable glass items.\n\n\n## Fallarbor Town\n\nThe small town ofFallarboris located between Routes113and114, and features rich soil perfect for gardening. A thirdBattle Tentis located here. The town is also home to aMove ManiacandProfessor Cozmo.\n\n\n### Meet Lanette\n\nInside the Pokémon Center, you find the PC in use by a woman namedLanette. She upgraded the previous version of thePokémon Storage System, adding a user-friendly graphical interface, the ability to store over 400 Pokémon, and the ability to change thewallpaperof each Box. As she leaves, she invites you to visit her home onRoute 114.\n\n\n### Move Tutor\n\nThere is a girl inside the Poké Mart, examining the merchandise displayed on the rear wall. Speak to her, and she offers to teach the moveMetronometo a Pokémon, one time only.\n\n\n### Battle Tent\n\nTheFallarbor Battle Tentstands on the north side of town, and is the third of three scattered throughoutHoenn. At this location, challengers select three of their Pokémon to battle three opposing Trainers. These Trainers' Pokémon will either be level 30, or match the highest-leveled Pokémon in your party, whichever is higher. Each separate Pokémon face-off has a three-turn limit. If neither Pokémon has been knocked out in that time, the judge makes a ruling that depends on three factors: Mind, the amount of offensive moves; Skill, the accuracy of moves; and Body, the remaining HP. Possible scores for each category include Circle (a win, 2 points), Triangle (a tie, 1 point), and X (a loss, 0 points). The Pokémon that earns the most points wins. The reward for winning three consecutive battles here is aHyper Potion.\n\nScottcan be found inside the entry hall. He is impressed that you've stopped by, as most people around here are easygoing and laid-back, and urges you to make a challenge.\n\n\n### Move Maniac\n\nTheMove Maniaclives in the northwest house. This helpful guy knows every move a Pokémon can learn as it grows, and is able to teach forgotten moves to any Pokémon, for a price. He charges a singleHeart Scalefor each move relearned. While a few can be found on the beach as invisible items right now, you will need to wait until you encounter wildLuvdisclater on to be able to collect a more steady supply.\n\n\n## Route 114\n\nPockmarked by fallen Meteorites, the lengthyRoute 114leads up the mountainside toMeteor Falls. TheFossil Maniaclives up north, whileLanette's home stands on the water's edge.\n\n\n### Fossil Maniac\n\nTheFossil Maniac's house stands on the outskirts ofFallarbor Town. Head inside and talk to his little brother, who kindly gives youTM28(Dig). When used in the field, Dig can be used while in a cave to return to the entrance. If you visit the cave at the back of the house, you will find the Fossil Maniac hard at work. He won't give up any Fossils, but hints that others may be uncovered byRoute 111's raging sandstorm.\n\n\n### Lanette's House\n\nGo south across the bridge to reachLanette's house. Inside, you find the woman struggling to organize her clutter. She is happy that you stopped by, but embarrassed by the state of her home. If you promise to keep her messiness a secret, she will give you aLotad Dollin return.\n\n\n### A Berry A Day\n\nSpeak to the boy outside Lanette's house and he will give out one random Berry from a group of five every day.", 'description': 'Pokemon Emerald Walkthrough - Part 6'}

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.

Some pointers to keep in mind (guard rails) as you problem solve:
1) You must think step-by-step when solving problems and making decisions. 
2) Always provide detailed, context-aware responses that bias for ground-truth.
3) Consider the current situation in the game as well as what you've learned over time.
4) Do not fixate on the correctness of a particular solution, be flexible and adapt your strategy as needed.
